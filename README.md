HOW TO DEPLOY
Note: The current build of the game only works on Windows devices

1. Download the zip file titled "Playable Build"
2. Extract the files to whatever directory you wish to hold the game
3. If security prompts come up, ignore them (no viruses here, we promise)
4. Open ChaosClass.exe, and the game should start up.
