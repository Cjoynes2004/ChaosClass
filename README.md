CIS 376 Group 5 Term Project

HOW TO DEPLOY
Note: The current build of the game only works on Windows devices

1. Download the zip file titled "Playable Build"
2. Extract the files to whatever directory you wish to hold the game
3. If security prompts come up, ignore them (no viruses here, we promise). You may need to disable built in virus protection software temporarily.
5. Open ChaosClass.exe, and the game should start up.
